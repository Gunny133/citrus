    <h3>Code repository</h3>

    <p>The samples are available at the <b><a href="https://github.com/christophd/citrus-samples" target="_blank">Citrus Github repository</a></b>.
      After cloning the repository you can build and execute the samples on your local machine.</p>

    <h3>Build</h3>

    <p>The sample application uses Maven as build tool. So you can compile, package and test the
      sample with Maven.</p>

    <figure class="highlight">
      <pre>mvn clean install -Dembedded=true</pre>
    </figure>

    <p>This executes the complete Maven build lifecycle. The embedded option automatically starts a Jetty web
      container before the integration test phase. The todo-list system under test is automatically deployed in this phase.
      After that the Citrus test cases are able to interact with the todo-list application in the integration test phase.</p>

    <p>During the build you will see Citrus performing some integration tests.
    After the tests are finished the embedded Jetty web container and the todo-list application are automatically stopped.</p>

    <h3>System under test</h3>

    <p>The sample uses a small todo list application as system under test. The application is a web application
    that you can deploy on any web container. You can find the todo-list sources [here](../todo-app). Up to now we have started an
    embedded Jetty web container with automatic deployments during the Maven build lifecycle. This approach is fantastic
    when running automated tests in a continuous build.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately the Jetty server and the sample application automatically get stopped when the Maven build is finished.
    There may be times we want to test against a standalone todo-list application.</p>

    <p>You can start the sample todo list application in Jetty with this command.</p>

    <figure class="highlight">
      <pre>mvn jetty:run</pre>
    </figure>

    <p>This starts the Jetty web container and automatically deploys the todo list app. Point your browser to</p>

    <figure class="highlight">
      <pre>http://localhost:8080/todolist/</pre>
    </figure>

    <p>You will see the web UI of the todo list and add some new todo entries.</p>

    <p>Now we are ready to execute some Citrus tests in a separate JVM.</p>

    <h3>Citrus test</h3>

    <p>Once the sample application is deployed and running you can execute the Citrus test cases.
    Open a separate command line terminal and navigate to the sample folder.</p>

    <p>Execute all Citrus tests by calling</p>

    <figure class="highlight">
      <pre>mvn clean verify</pre>
    </figure>

    <p>You can also pick a single test by calling</p>

    <figure class="highlight">
      <pre>mvn clean verify -Ptest=TodoListIT</pre>
    </figure>

    <p>You should see Citrus performing several tests with lots of debugging output in both terminals (sample application server
    and Citrus test client). And of course green tests at the very end of the build.</p>

    <p>Of course you can also start the Citrus tests from your favorite IDE.
    Just start the Citrus test using the TestNG IDE integration in IntelliJ, Eclipse or Netbeans.</p>
